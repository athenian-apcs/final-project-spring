# Dice Methods

In this assignment, you'll be writing some code to practice using Streams in Java.
Each of your functions should just be a single statement. You don't need any loops! The number of intermediate
operations allowed for each function is listed above it. Note that these do not include the call to stream() or
any terminal operations such as collect() or allMatch().

Add code to [MyMain.java](src/main/java/MyMain.java) to do the desired thing.

## Run your code with:
The easiest way to run your code is to press the play button in [MyMain.java](src/main/java/MyMain.java).

However, you can also run your code by typing the following into the Terminal.

```shell script
make run
```

Alternatively, if that doesn't work, use:

```shell script
./gradlew run
```

## Run your tests with:
The easiest way to run your code is to press the play button in [MyTests.java](src/test/java/MyTests.java).

However, you can also run your code by typing the following into the Terminal.

```shell script
make test
```

Alternatively, if that doesn't work, use:

```shell script
./gradlew test
```
